To achieve this, it would be necessary to have uniform grammar, pronunciation and more common words.</p><p>If several languages coalesce, the grammar of the resulting language is more simple and regular than that of the individual languages. The new common language will be more simple and regular than the existing European languages. It will be as simple as Occidental; in fact, it will be Occidental.</p>"
